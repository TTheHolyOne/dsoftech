The darker side of revolves around hacking, doxing, ddosing, cracking, and more. I also would like to clear up that hacking, cracking, programming, etc are completely different things. I am interested in learning more about the topic of the Dark Side of Technology and more about the hacking aspect. \n Dark side of Technology is everywhere, hackers, crackers, ddosers, and more is becoming more common nowadays. While many people may think that they know a lot about it.. They don’t. This is important because while people believe they know a lot about it, they may be getting hacked etc. \n On the other hand it could technically help us. Say if someone doxes a person that we need to find, it could help us find the person. This shows that some parts of the DSOFTECH can be helpful. \nThe Dark Side of Techonology is everywhere, it may be hurting us and it may be helping us. All in all, its getting more common and that is why more people need to learn about it. \nI hope you like my project, \nJacob Thacker')"><button><img

		<p>Hacking is a major part of the dark side of technology. For instance, people will hack other peoples accounts
			to get access to money and games. Also it doesnt even have to involve coding. You can hack by social
			engineering etc, which is tricking someone into doing things or telling you things. Linux is also a very
			popular OS for hacking as well. This shows that hacking takes place on the dark side of technology and is
			very important to it. Hacking, while can be good(Security Tests) is very involved in the bad side of
			technology, making it a role in the dark side of technology.

		<p>Programming, the thing that revolves tech, it is quite a cool thing and can be used for good but hackers and
			crackers use it to do very bad things. A hacker and cracker could say create a program, a phishing site, etc
			to get information or other things. This shows that hackers, etc can use programming to their advantage.
			Programming is a great thing, I love to program and many do, while it is a great thing, bad people can
			create many things with it that can be bad, and good. </p>

		<p>Doxing is often used in bad ways to gather information. A person would usually gather information by DOXING
			and then release it online. While DOXING people you may not like may sound like fun, it is illegal and can
			do LOTS of harm to others and that shows how it is bad. I personally do not agree with doxing, a person
			could say that its okay.

			For example, a person throws, says slurs, hurt a person and tries to hide, I could see where it could be ok
			to dox them. It is illegal to do so but it can also help the authorities. It really isn’t a nice thing to do
			but again, I can see where it would be ok.

			So, thats about it for doxing. I believe that it isn’t okay but I guess I can let it slide depending on the
			situation. Thats why I believe doxing is from the Dark Side of Technology and that it can be a horrible
			thing to do and can harm the person and others close to the person.

			DDOSING is often used in bad ways to gather and prevent users from protecting themselves. A person would
			usually gather information usually from doxing and then use an IP address they gathered to DDOS to either,
			be rude or prevent them from protecting themself. While DDOSING people you may not like may sound like fun,
			it is illegal and can do LOTS of harm to others and that shows how it is bad.
			See now, that's DDOSING but it could also be used in DOXING
			Someone who doxes another person would dig up information about someone usually using osint tools. They
			would proceed to then release this information online which usually leads to unwanted pranks at your house,
			911 prank calls, and could even lead to people going to your house or stealing your accounts. Also, ddosing
			could be including with this as they may get your IP and use that information to shut down your internet
			connection.

			For example, a person on a online video game may be annoying someone. This someone might know how to do some
			things and use tools online to gather information. After they post it online they will usually tell the
			person how is PLACENAME? It will scare the person and then at the end it will usually end a DDOs, shutting
			down the internet connection to the person. This is very common on Call Of Duty etc..

			I dont agree with this as I feel like its wrong but most people online say otherwise. This is very common
			online and now gets easier and easier to do. While it is common it is also illegal. That is why I believe
			its wrong, other than human morals its wrong to release private information and stopping someone from
			accessing the internet.

			That is why Doxing and DDosing may work together well. Many people use this in combos sa it may help them.
			Other than that, thats it with DOXING and DDOSING. I have never DDOSED before but I have DOXED and I have
			fully regretted it.

			Cracking is super important to the dark side of technology. It is used by a lot of people to create tools
			and programs to break into things for hackers to use later on. This shows that Cracking helps Hacking so
			involved and it is a bad thing to do. This shows that it is the Dark Side of Technology. Cracking, I don’t
			exactly see it could be good other than helping companies build security, it is bad and takes an important
			role in the dark side of technology.
